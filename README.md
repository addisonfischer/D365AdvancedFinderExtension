Works in all (hopefully) \*make.powerapps.com/\*


#### Intallation
- Go to releases on the rignt
- Download the latest zip
- Unzip to a local folder
- in Developer Mode in chrome://extensions choose 'Load unpacked' then selected the unzipped 'advancedFinderExt' directory

#### Usage
When in a *make.powerapps.com/* environment, this will allow you to quickly access the Advanced Finder


#### Bugs
When switching environments (DEV -> PROD, etc), you either need to refresh the page or navigate to another location within the environment (such as Flows or Solutions, etc), else the extension will load the first environment's Advanced Find
